Hello !

I am Florent Marlin,

I have worked as an engineer in the aerospace industry for over 20 years,
and I moved from being a structural analyst ... to developing analysis-tools and supporting fellow analysts.

My interests in programming, data-handling and problem-solving have always infused my professional career.

This portfolio aims at presenting some of my works, in professional and personal contexts.
