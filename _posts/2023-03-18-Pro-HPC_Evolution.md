Analysis of Software Pool for industry

This activity was performed in my position as an engineer in the aerospace industry.


<h3>Context</h3>

The design office used a number of commercial software dedicated to numerical- and aerospace-analysis.

This software typically is subject to recurrent license fees from their respective editors.

On a yearly basis, my team was tasked with the update of needs in terms of licensed software, with the objective to ...
<ul class="list-group">
  <li class="list-group-item">... keep up with increasing or decreasing needs</li>
  <li class="list-group-item">... optimize the license pool and reduce costs where possible</li>
</ul>

<div class="mt20"></div>

<h3>Developments</h3>

I helped set up the monitoring of software use.

I made surveys in the design office to have a forecast of needs with respect to incoming workload.

I analyzed the performance of the existing pool vs. the future needs, and came up with recommendations.

I challenged the metrics proposed by other actors in the company, that would have proved detrimental for the operational performance.

<h3>Result</h3>

I shared with my manager the requirements in terms of licences (conversions, new acquisitions).


<h3>Details</h3>

Following tools were used:
<ul class="list-group">
  <li class="list-group-item">Python</li>
  <li class="list-group-item">Pandas</li>
</ul>
